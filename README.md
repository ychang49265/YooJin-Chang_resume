## Objective
As an empathetic and driven engineer, I thrive in the area of making technology enjoyable and accessible to all. Experienced in developing full-stack applications with a focus on React/Redux, Node.js/Express, SQL and NoSQL. 
___
## Technical Skills

**Proficient:** JavaScript (ES6+), React (Router, Hooks, Context API), WebRTC, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS/SaSS/Tailwind, Git/Github, NoSQL (MongoDB/Mongoose), Postman, Web Protocols, WebSockets, OOP.

**Knowledgeable:** SQL (Postgres/MySQL), REST API, Redux, Webpack, testing (Jest/SuperTest), authentication (OAuth, Bcrypt, JWT), TypeScript, AWS.

## Projects

**RTConnect** - _WebRTC, Websockets, React, Typescript, Node.js, Express, AWS, CSS, Sass, Tailwind_  
- Collaborated with a team of engineers to develop a React component library that allows developers to rapidly implement real-time video calls between two peers, expediting the process of setting up WebRTC, and decreasing the barrier of entry for those unfamiliar with the technology.
- Led the team in creating and designing the landing page for the product. Incorporated React Router to create a cohesive user experience, displaying multiple client views on a single page application, and creating intuitive routes using navigational components all while minimizing calls to the server to dynamically and conditionally render various page views.

**NoteTube** - _React, TypeScript Express, PostgreSQL API, CRUD_  
- Created an application that enables timestamped note-taking for youtube video content. Used React to build reusable, modular frontend components with React Hooks to define, hold, and update state, enforcing one-way data flow from parent components to child components while maintaining minimal re-renders.
- Employed static typing by harnessing the Typescript superset to give the code more structure, make it self-documenting resulting in less error-prone code and better performance at runtime.

**ConnectI/On** - _JavaScript, React, CSS, Sass, API, OAuth, SQL_  
- Created a Community Events Finder application focusing on developing an authentication system that focused on the end user data security by integrating a combination of cookies and bcrypt to encrypt sensitive user data, providing a streamlined user signup process.
- Utilized SQL, a relational database used to store user data, user-created events, and chat messages. Utilized join tables to easily and efficiently combine data to be used in different views.

**EasyMed** - _React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React Hooks, CSS, Sass, CRUD, API_  
- Designed and developed primary UI components and optimized styling protocols with the use of higher order React components, styled components, and a defined style guide in order to maintain overall code quality and cleanliness.
- Leveraged mongoDB’s scalability and enforced uniqueness in the user collection to prevent data redundancy, utilizing models to group data into human readable and flexible documents to simplify data storage.
- Constructed Node.js/Express server to efficiently handle asynchronous HTTP/API requests to various endpoints using the middleware design pattern, using routers and controllers to modularize requests with reliable debugging.
