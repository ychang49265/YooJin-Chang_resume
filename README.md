## Projects

**RTConnect** - _WebRTC, Websockets, React, Typescript, Node.js, Express, AWS, CSS, Sass, Tailwind_  
- Collaborated with a team of engineers to develop a React component library that allows developers to rapidly implement real-time video calls between two peers, expediting the process of setting up WebRTC, and decreasing the barrier of entry for those unfamiliar with the technology.
[View GitHub](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/RTConnect)
- Led the team in creating and designing the landing page for the product. Designed and developed primary UI components and optimized styling protocols with the use of higher order React components, Styled components, and a defined style guide in order to maintain overall code quality and cleanliness.
[View Website](https://www.rtconnect.org/) | [GitHub for Landing Page](https://github.com/ychang49265/LandingPage) 
- Incorporated React Router to create a cohesive user experience, displaying multiple client views on a single page application, and creating intuitive routes using navigational components all while minimizing calls to the server to dynamically and conditionally render various page views.
- Engineered a persistent bi-directional messaging pattern using Websockets to create an interactive
communication session between the peer's browser and server in order to connect reliably.
- Configured AWS (S3) for their scalable and flexible cloud storage to securely manage RTConnect’s data and to deploy a companion website with global edge caching on HTTPS for improved access and speed.

**NoteTube** - _React, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL API, CRUD_  
- Created an application that enables timestamped note-taking for youtube video content. Used React to build reusable, modular frontend components with React Hooks to define, hold, and update state, enforcing one-way data flow from parent components to child components while maintaining minimal re-renders.

- Implemented TypeScript to improve efficiency and to reduce errors by preventing unintentional type coercion, ensuring the data passed from the database to the cache are consistent data types.
- Constructed Node.js/Express server to efficiently handle asynchronous HTTP/API requests to various endpoints using the middleware design pattern, using routers and controllers to modularize requests with reliable debugging. 

**ConnectI/On** - _JavaScript, React, CSS, Sass, API, OAuth, SQL_  
- Created a Social Events Finder application customized for users seeking events near one's location.
[View GitHub](https://github.com/TeamStabRabbits/Scratch-Project) 
- Utilized SQL, a relational database used to store user data, user-created events, and chat messages. Utilized join tables to easily and efficiently combine data to be used in different views.
- Applied user authentication with JWTs to serve pages via user-facing authentication securely with minimal user effort

**EasyMed** - _React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React Hooks, CSS, Sass, CRUD, API_  
- Leveraged mongoDB’s scalability and enforced uniqueness in the user collection to prevent data redundancy, utilizing models to group data into human readable and flexible documents to simplify data storage.
- Incorporated Test Driven Development using Jest to create an intuitive codebase with automated testing support.
